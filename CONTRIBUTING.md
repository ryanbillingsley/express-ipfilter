# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/express-ipfilter.git

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

Make sure the tests pass:

    npm test

Make your change. **Add tests** for your change. Make the tests pass:

    npm test

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
